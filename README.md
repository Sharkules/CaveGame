# CaveGame
A game about being in a cave. (S1-2023-ID737001-GD)

# Loose Outline
"For mechanics I'm thinking:

-First Person Controller

-Flashlight (with the ability to have the light flicker at random moments, you probably start off the game by picking it up off the cave floor

-Interact (To pick the flashlight up, open doors maybe?)

-Squeeze/Crouch (The cave narrows at certain points and you have to wiggle your mouse to move through)

-Volume Triggers (Zones where we detect that the player has hit and play an environmental effect, change the level etc)

 

Rough outline of the game is you start off in a caved-in tunnel, then pick up your flashlight and try to find another exit. The middle section becomes more labryinthine as you have to find some THINGS to progress, here there'd be suggestions that the player isn't alone/that there is a monster of some sort. (Which doesn't have to actually exist if you use well timed sound effects etc instead to imply its existence.). After you leave that section, some more claustrophobic sections until the cave suddenly starts to open up impossibly wide, until you can't see the cave walls or ceiling any more, or even where you came from, with stars starting to appear as you go deeper, and then it ends on that kinda mysterious ending."
